      Consists of:

      - HTTP method e.g. [`GET], [`POST]
      - [path] i.e. a list of path segments

      E.g., [GET /api/user/1] would be represented as
      [(`GET, ["api", "user", "1"])] *)

  (** A service is an asynchronous function that handles a request and
      returns a response. See also {!module:Filter} for filters which
      can manipulate services. *)

  type 'ctx t = route -> 'ctx service
  (** A server is a function that takes a [route] and returns a service.
      A route is pattern-matchable (see above), so you will almost
      always do that to handle different endpoints with different
      services. *)

  val serve : ?port:int -> unit t -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [serve ?port server] starts the top-level [server] listening on
      [port]. Top-level servers must have no context i.e. their context
      is [()]. *)
